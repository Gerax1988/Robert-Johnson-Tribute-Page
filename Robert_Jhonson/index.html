    <h1>Robert Jhonson</h1>

    <h2>The musician that sold his soul to the devil</h2>

    <p>
        Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 â€“ August 16, 1938) was an American blues musician and songwriter. His landmark
        recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has
        influenced later generations of musicians. He is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly the Delta
        blues style.

    <h3>The singer and the devil</h3>

    <p>
        According to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Johnson had a tremendous desire
        to become a great blues musician. One of the legends often told says that Johnson was instructed to take his
        guitar to a crossroad near Dockery Plantation at midnight. (There are claims for at least a dozen other sites as
        the location of the crossroads.).There he was met by a large black man (the Devil) who took the guitar and tuned
        it. The Devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument.
        This story of a deal with the Devil at the crossroads mirrors the legend of Faust. In exchange for his soul,
        Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.

    <h4>Death of a legend</h4>

    <p>
        Johnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near Greenwood, Mississippi, of unknown causes. His death was
        not reported publicly; he merely disappeared from the historical record and it was not until almost 30 years
        later, when Gayle Dean Wardlow, a Mississippi-based musicologist researching Johnson's life, found his death
        certificate, which listed only the date and location, with no official cause of death. No formal autopsy was
        done; instead, a pro forma examination was done to file the death certificate, and no immediate cause of death
        was determined. It is likely he had congenital syphilis and it was suspected later by medical professionals that
        may have been a contributing factor in his death. However, 30 years of local legend and oral tradition had, like
        the rest of his life story, built a legend which has filled in gaps in the scant historical record.
